# **App Name**: SwiftRoute

## Core Features:

- Product Listings: Display products with images, descriptions, and prices.
- Shopping Cart: Allow users to add products to a cart and manage quantities.
- Dummy Map Generation: Generate a dummy map with at least 20 locations to simulate delivery points.
- Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation: Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between the warehouse and delivery locations.
- Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver: Implement TSP to optimize the delivery route for multiple destinations, minimizing total travel distance.
- Max Flow Algorithm: Utilize the Max Flow algorithm to determine the maximum number of packages that can be delivered from the warehouse to different locations within a specific timeframe.
- Route Visualization: Visually display the optimized delivery route on the dummy map, highlighting the path and delivery locations.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#1A237E), evoking trust and reliability.
- Background color: Light Gray (#F5F5F5), for a clean and modern look.
- Accent color: Bright Yellow (#FFEB3B), to highlight important interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body and 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines. 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for map coordinates.
- Use minimalist icons to represent product categories and delivery-related actions.
- Use a grid-based layout to organize products and information efficiently.
- Subtle transitions and animations when adding products to the cart or updating delivery routes.
